# ⏱️ Tito – Time Tracking for Shift Workers

Tito is a minimalist mobile app built with **React Native** and **Expo** for shift workers to log hours, calculate earnings, and track weekly goals.  
The project demonstrates building a fully functional mobile app from start to finish, including **authentication, backend integration, local caching, cloud sync, and deployment readiness**.

## 📦 Technologies

- React Native  
- Expo  
- TypeScript  
- Supabase

- React Navigation  
- Expo Application Services (EAS)  
- Model Context Protocol (MCP)  

## ✨ Features

### Shift Logging & Tracking

- Quick logging of shifts with start/end times, hourly rate, and notes  
- Automatic earnings calculation in real-time  
- Weekly goal tracking and visualization  

### Authentication & Data Sync

- Google Sign-In for secure authentication  
- Cloud sync via Supabase to access data across devices  
- Local caching with AsyncStorage for offline support  

### User Experience & Design
